Among the living beings humans changed their life style and engaged in routine activities as per their status and needs. In the early stages humans did not produce either arms or fire for their daily needs. As time went on and with development, arms were made with stones, fire was discovered which was used against each other and crimes were committed against each other. With the development of human beings more and more crimes were committed. With the recognition of crime as one of the social problems many methods and controls were implemented without much success. The unethical social practices which are practiced to date are a hindrance to control crimes at times. It is assumed that law had not being implemented freely due to these beliefs.</p><br><p>Anti-social activities prevail in all countries. Although the same type of crime is committed depending on the cultural and social background of the country. Cultural-social background is decided whether it is a crime or not. It is due to these facts that an act of crime is legal and illegal in decided in various countries. As an example gay marriages are legal in some countries and illegal in other countries. Sri Lanka is a developing country situated in South Asia and differs from European countries on many matters due to its own cultural heritage. The 1978 constitution clearly outlines the frame work of the criminal law and the criminal procedure law to be implemented in Sri Lanka.</p><br><p>According to the studies and research done in Sri Lanka on crimes committed, it is evident that crimes committed on children and women have increased. It is also found that drug abuse is one of the main reasons for such crimes. A clear picture of the crimes committed in Sri Lanka is outlined in the official data released for the period 2013-2016</p><br><p>In the years 2013 and 2014 offenses against women were named and categorized only under Rape/Incest. At the same time offences against children were categorized only under Cruelty to Children and Sexual Exploitation. With effect from 2015, the number of grave crimes increased from 21 to 26. As per this the grave crimes against women were increased from 01 to 03 accordingly:</p><br><br><ol><li>Rape of Women over 16 years of age</li><li>Statutory Rape (Women under 16 years) With the consent of the victim</li><li>Statutory Rape (Women under 16 years) without the consent of the victim, It was categorized.(When elaborating the data all 03 sections are brought under main offence of crimes against women)</li></ol><br><br><p>At the same time amendments were introduced in 2015 for crimes against children and it was brought under 02 headings. That is:</p><br><ol><li>Cruelty to children</li><li>Sexual Exploitation of children</li></ol><div id=chartCrimeOne style="height: 500px; width: 100%;"></div><br><p class=center-text-align><strong>Source: www.police.lk</strong></p><br><p>As for the figures available for the period of 2013 to 2016 the grave crimes committed against women and children had not increased drastically. A slight decrease is seen on the grave crimes as per the following chart</p><div id=chartCrimeTwo style="height: 500px; width: 100%;"></div><br><p class=center-text-align><strong>Source: www.police.lk</strong></p><p>According to the figures the grave crimes against women and children stands between 2000 and 2200 during the period 2013 to 2016.</p><h4><u><strong>District/City-wise Crime Activities</strong></u></h4><p>Crimes against women and children were committed mainly in the following cities during the period 2013 to 2016:</p><ol><li>Anuradhapura</li><li>Nugegoda</li><li>Tangalle</li><li>Kandy</li><li>Matara</li><li>Ratnapura</li><li>Polonnaruwa</li><li>Moneragala</li><li>Elpitiya</li><li>Sitawakapura</li></ol><h4><u><strong>Human Trafficking and Computer Crimes</strong></u></h4><p>As per the Sri Lankan law, apart from gave crimes against women and children, there are many other crimes where both are victims of such crimes. Crimes such as murder bring great impact on the society. Although it women are being victimized of such crimes, it is difficult to measure the quantity of the victimization according to the gender.</p><br><p>Women and children get victimized in human trafficking which is a global issue and is mostly spoken in Sri Lanka in present. Especially with the promises of finding employment women and children get victimized and are forced into prostitution, slavery and exploitation of labor at some stage.</p><br><p>In the background of computer crimes committed in Sri Lanka there is a trend of such crimes in recent years. Women and children again are victimized by such crimes. Promoting children as sexual brands and availability of pornographic films had paved the way for crimes and has brought the whole society to disgrace.</p><h4><u><strong>Control and Prevention</strong></u></h4><p>Taking appropriate action against anti social activities in a society is considered a positive step to control such crimes. Although there is no major change in the crime rate, the law enforcement institutions are on alert at all times. It is due to this, that amendments were brought in 2015 to the grave crimes act to control such activities. Although there is enough law to control and prevent grave crimes, an implementation mechanism is needed to enforce it. It is important to identify the reasons behind the escalation of crimes and solutions are to be found. It is noted that only crimes reported to police are available on data. In most of the cases victims do not complain to the police due to social issues, ignorance, threatening and to hide their identity, because they are at the receiving end. At the same time the loop holes in the law and the short comings in the leading of the evidence brings such cases to stand still. It is appropriate to take alternate remedies for implementation of the law at such times. At most instances,</p><ol><li>Poverty</li><li>Drug abuse</li><li>Unawareness</li><li>Lack of education</li><li>Social factors</li><li>Intimate relationships</li><li>Cultural factors</li></ol><br><p>are reasons for the escalation of crimes. In order to avoid such crimes a day to day awareness is not enough. It is important to change the attitude once and for all if permanent solution is to be found. As such,</p><br><ol><li>Awareness programs</li><li>Personality development workshops</li><li>Legal enforcement seminars</li></ol><br><p>Are some of the remedial measures that should be implemented on ground level. It is the vision to build an environmental friendly future generation who do not consider race, religion, sect, party, and color at all as basic day to day needs. It is in this backdrop that “Sri Lankan key” organization is trying to change attitudes positively among the society permanently against the exploitation of women and children through www.srilankankey.com TVSL Key Programs.</p></section></div></div>
