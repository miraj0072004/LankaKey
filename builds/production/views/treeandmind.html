The busy elderly Sri Lankans living all over the world can become shareholders of this great project by contributing Rs.1000/ towards the education of the students who are involved in the growing of the tree. This motivates the students to take more interest in planting more trees while attending to their studies.</p><u><strong>What Are the Benefits of This?</strong></u><br><br><p>For The Students…</p><br><p>At the present scenario a student’s life is limited towards books and the student turn towards new technologies as the education system itself is a challenge now a days. Students compete with each other to score more marks for which they are forcibly driven within the present education system. By initiating this tree growing project students get an environmental experience and they get to know the environment better. The student grows up with the environment and the child accepts and considers the tree as a friend. At the same time the child recognizes and understands the society and begins to live as a well natured citizen in the future. The funds received through the Foster Parents Scheme are spent for the education of the student which is a great benefit to them. At the same time with the availability of information regarding the student, tree and photographs in the internet students are to get local and international scholarships through various sourses.As a long term benefits students will get employment opportunities as well from employers who are looking at young talents.</p><br><p>For the Elders…</p><br><p>As a citizen of Sri Lanka they get the opportunity to get involved directly or indirectly by contributing towards the Foster Parents Scheme which is considered as an obligatory of the elders. On the other hand as these contributions are used for the education of the students they become partners for the creation of sustainable Sri Lanka.</p><br><p>For the Environment…</p><br><p>In terms of natural environment Sri Lanka is a country which is in a very high position. At present with the increase of Factories, Tourist Industry, many human settlements, various Development projects, Furniture and consumption of fuel are identified as reasons for the destruction of the natural environment of the country. With the implementation of the tree planting campaign project the safety of the natural environment is assured and it will protect the environment at all times.</p><u><strong>To the Whole Society</strong></u><br><br><p>It is noted that the breakdown in the society as a whole is the lack of credibility and understanding among the various societies. The present social believes and values are the results of the loss of credibility and values among the societies. The impact here is the personnel attitudes and behavioral patterns among the different societies. The changes that took place over the years among the different societies on human nature are the reasons for the social insecurity among the societies. In order to regain the lost social insecurity a better understanding should be created among the future generations. Especially it is important that a child should be brought up in a surrounding in which he loves the environment above all. Accordingly under this project a student gets the opportunity to be friends with the tree and to develop together with the tree. With this development and as expected the student gets the opportunity to think positively and develop a future full of values. By these actions it paves the way for a better future friendly social environment and a better future investment is created.</p></div></section></div></div>
